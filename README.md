# Minh-Ha Le  
**Principal Research Engineer | Deep Learning & Privacy Enthusiast | DevOps & Cloud Expert**

ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on**  
Building the AIDA Data Science Platform at AIDA DataHub (SciLifeLab, Sweden), designing infrastructure for sensitive data research. My focus is on end-to-end platform setup, from bare-metal provisioning with MAAS to deploying OpenStack private clouds and containerizing deep learning stacks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) for AI/ML researchers.

ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning**  
Advanced techniques in generative models (e.g., Diffusion Models, GANs) and privacy-preserving AI, alongside scaling DevOps practices with tools like Terraform, Ansible, and KubeFlow.

ðŸ‘¯ **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on**  
Projects involving generative AI, adversarial machine learning, privacy-enhancing technologies, or large-scale cloud/HPC infrastructure for research.

ðŸ¤” **Iâ€™m looking for help with**  
Optimizing high-resolution image generation workflows and exploring new privacy frameworks for vision-language models.

ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about**  
Generative models, DevOps automation, cloud infrastructure, or my research on anonymizing facial recognition dataâ€”Iâ€™m happy to chat!

âš¡ **Fun fact**  
Iâ€™ve lived and worked in four countries (Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, Sweden) and can debug code in Python faster than I can make a cup of coffee!
